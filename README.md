# WeatherReact
Weather application using React

Link to application: http://salty-everglades-91269.herokuapp.com/#/

Here is what the application looks like when you first arrive

A quick demonstration of what happens when you look up a city for its temperature

There is an examples tab that has cities that you can click and get direct information about the temperature in those cities

You can also search using the search bar in the top right

What about errors? If you type in a city that does not exist, then this modal will appear

Shameless plug after the application's technologies
